# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A machine learning–based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and similarity patterns.  
This project demonstrates the practical application of recommendation algorithms and data analysis techniques.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The system analyzes user preferences and movie features to generate personalized movie recommendations.  
It helps users discover relevant movies efficiently by leveraging similarity metrics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Recommendation Technique
- Content-Based Filtering
- Similarity Measurement using Cosine Similarity

## ✨ Key Features
- Personalized movie recommendations
- Efficient similarity-based filtering
- Clean and modular code structure
- Scalable for large datasets

## 📂 Dataset
- Movie metadata dataset (genres, ratings, overview, etc.)
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction applied

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Preprocesses movie data and extracts relevant features  
2. Computes similarity between movies using cosine similarity  
3. Recommends top similar movies based on user input  

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with recommendation systems
- Improved understanding of similarity algorithms
